# Nodejs Master Class
Building a RESTful API for an uptime monitoring application. An "uptime monitor" allows users to enter URLs they want monitored, and receive alerts when those resources "go down" or "come back up".

# Requirements
1. The API listens on a PORT and accepts incoming HTTP requests for POST, GET, PUT, DELETE and HEAD.
2. The API allows a client to connect, then create a new user, then edit and delete that user.
3. The API allows a user to "sign in" which gives them a token that they can use for subsequent authenticated requests.
4. The API allows the user to "sign out" which invalidates their token.
5. The API allows a signed-in user to use their token to create a new "check".
6. The API allows a signed-in user to edit or delete any of their checks.
7. In the background, workers perform all the "checks" at the appropriate times, and send alerts to the users when a check changes its state from "up" to "down", or vice versa.

# Notes
1. Send SMS via Twilio. (pass: abCD12--123456)
2. Use the filesystem as a key-value store of JSON docs.

# Scripts
## Create ssl certificate: 
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
